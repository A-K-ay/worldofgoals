### 3.2 Local Backend Architecture

#### Database Choice: PostgreSQL with Drift
For the MVP phase, we will implement a local backend using PostgreSQL with Drift (SQL toolkit) for the following reasons:

1. **Data Structure Benefits**:
   - Strong data integrity through ACID compliance
   - Complex relationships between users, tasks, and rewards
   - Rich querying capabilities for leaderboards and analytics
   - Schema validation and type safety
   - Excellent support for transactions (critical for XP and rewards)

2. **Performance Advantages**:
   - Efficient query execution
   - Built-in support for indexing
   - Connection pooling capabilities
   - Optimized for relational data

3. **Development Benefits**:
   - Type-safe database operations through Drift
   - Robust migration system
   - Clear data modeling
   - Easy debugging and maintenance
   - Simplified testing

4. **Future-Proofing**:
   - Easy migration path to cloud backend in v2
   - Schema compatibility with future Go backend
   - Built-in support for data export/import
   - Scalable architecture foundation

#### Implementation Details

1. **Database Layer**:
   - Drift for type-safe SQL operations
   - PostgreSQL for local storage
   - Connection pooling for performance
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive data

2. **Data Models**:
   ```dart
   // Example User Model
   class User {
     final String id;
     final String username;
     final String email;
     final int xp;
     final int level;
     final DateTime createdAt;
     final DateTime updatedAt;
   }

   // Example Task Model
   class Task {
     final String id;
     final String userId;
     final String title;
     final String description;
     final TaskDifficulty difficulty;
     final int xpReward;
     final TaskStatus status;
     final DateTime dueDate;
     final DateTime? completedAt;
   }
   ```

3. **Repository Pattern**:
   - Abstraction layer for database operations
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Easy testing and mocking
   - Simplified data access

4. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Version-controlled schema changes
   - Automated migration system
   - Data integrity verification
   - Backup before migrations

#### Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypted database file
   - Secure credential storage
   - Protected user data
   - Safe XP transaction handling

2. **Access Control**:
   - Local authentication
   - Session management
   - Biometric authentication support
   - Secure token storage

#### V2 Migration Path

1. **Cloud Migration Strategy**:
   - Schema compatibility maintained
   - Data export/import utilities
   - Gradual transition support
   - Zero data loss guarantee

2. **API Preparation**:
   - RESTful API structure
   - Standard HTTP methods
   - Proper error handling
   - Authentication headers
